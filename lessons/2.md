## Pedagogical Concepts

Two learning praxis arcs:
1. Long arc to complexity: building up complexity one step at a time
2. Jagged arc: Long arc to complexity, made up of shorter arcs. As new tools or workflows are introduced and integrated, there will be restarts to an earlier point in the progression
3. Rapid prototyping: Starting from essentially zero or one on each project; smaller goals, built from scratch using different tools and tech

# Unit 1

## Goal-Oriented Learning

1. Make a basic HTML + CSS webpage
   1. Make first Git commit
   2. Publish to Vercel or Netlify
2. Add card element to the page
3. Add images to cards
4. Create a flexbox layout of 9 cards
5. Create a topnav layout
6. Create secondary pages to link to: Blog and About (reuse homepage markup & styles)
7. 


### Process


#### Student Process

* Make Git commits at every sub-section, or even more often as desired. Practice making concise but meaningful commit messages.
* Push whenever you want (which will update your live website)
* Have your website open in a browser via the Live Server extension, and your code open in VS Code. Have another window open to searching for answers and resources.
* When the layout or style isn't working as you want, always check the elements via Inspector (highlight elements and look at position, size, and box model)
* When you want to implement some CSS changes, do it in Inspector first, unless you're sure what you need to declare

#### Teaching Methods

1. Imperative: tell the student exactly what to do, and explain before, during, and/or after as appropriate
2. Declarative: tell the student what to achieve, providing specifications and visual references of the end state, and any relevant resources, tips or advice
3. Collaborative: ask the student what they want to achieve, come to a declared goal together, and guide them towards achieving it
4. Student As Teacher: student sets own goal, documents learning, and presents their results to peers (or roleplay peers)

#### Dissemination

1. Video + written instructions (on a course website)
   1. Normal lecture dissemination by video per unit/lesson of the course
   2. Includes written instructions, lists and explanations, diagrams, illustrations, mockups, demos
2. GitHub branches and commits
   1. Each course unit, unit lesson, and exercise are located with a course repository
      1. The units are given as branches
      2. The lessons and exercises are provided within separate commits, in order
      3. The practical material is located in the project, including:
         1. required/demo assets
         2. text/markdown files outlining lessons, exercises, and linking to resources
3. Live project pages
   1. webpages and interactive app components provide both written instructions and interactive exercises
   2. these can be bespoke and built for me course, or they can be linked to appropriate 3rd-party resources online

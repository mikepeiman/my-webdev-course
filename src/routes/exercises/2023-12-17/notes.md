Thinking about the process to develop a hex-grid-based game, as a learning path for Kaya and I in our webdev course.

1. Start with a container holding a square grid pattern. Integrate tweakpane or similar controls.
2. Offset even or odd rows or columns (user selection, variables)
3. Draw hexes on the points

- get tweakpane integrated with rows and cols
- build better template for exercises pages; include sidenav for subpages (generally simply a numbered folder)
- implement basic trig functions, draw the most regular shapes
